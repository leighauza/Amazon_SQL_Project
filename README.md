## 5. Automated Inventory Management (Stored Procedure)

The Automated Inventory Management stored procedure ensures real-time stock updates whenever a sale is processed. This function automatically checks product availability, records transactions, and updates inventory levels accordingly. If stock is insufficient, it prevents the sale and notifies the user. This process minimizes manual stock adjustments, improves inventory accuracy, and helps businesses maintain an efficient supply chain by reducing instances of overselling or stockouts.

```sql
-- This function creates a stored procedure that automatically reduces inventory levels when a sale is made.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_sales(
    p_order_id INT,
    p_customer_id INT,
    p_seller_id INT,
    p_order_item_id INT,
    p_product_id INT,
    p_quantity INT
)
RETURNS VOID
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
    v_count INT;
    v_price FLOAT;
    v_product VARCHAR(50);

BEGIN
    -- Fetch product name and price
    SELECT price, product_name 
    INTO v_price, v_product 
    FROM products 
    WHERE product_id = p_product_id; 

    -- Check stock and product availability
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    INTO v_count 
    FROM inventory
    WHERE product_id = p_product_id
    AND stock >= p_quantity;
    
    IF v_count > 0 THEN
        -- Insert into orders
        INSERT INTO orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id, seller_id)
        VALUES (p_order_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_customer_id, p_seller_id);

        -- Insert into order items
        INSERT INTO order_items(order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit, total_sale)
        VALUES (p_order_item_id, p_order_id, p_product_id, p_quantity, v_price, v_price * p_quantity);

        -- Update inventory
        UPDATE inventory
        SET stock = stock - p_quantity
        WHERE product_id = p_product_id;

        RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for your purchase. Your order for % is confirmed.', v_product;
    
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for your information. The product % is not available at the moment.', v_product;
    
    END IF;
    
END;
$$;
